## Context and Problem Statement

Selecting the most suitable UI framework for music player app that includes user registration, music library management, playlist creation, music streaming, music recommendations, and user interface. The app should provide a responsive, user-friendly interface that works across both iOS and Android platforms.  

## Considered Options

* Cross-platform framework with Xamarin or React Native.  
* Full native development using Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.  
* Progressive web app (PWA).  

## Decision Outcome

* Xamarin as the Cross-Platform UI Framework.  

## Rationale

* Use Xamarin for a single codebase that runs both iOS and Android platforms, reducing development time and cost.  
* With Xamarin the mobile development will be in one tech stack. Xamarin apps are always developed in C#, which allows developers to leverage the power of the .NET framework. 
* Responsive and user-friendly UI.  
* Xamarin helps to create consistent UI across platforms.  
* Strong support and resources since Xamarin is backed by Microsoft, it has very comprehensive documentation, courses, and tutorials to help developers.  

### Consequences 

* The biggest drawback of Xamarin can be its price.  
* Certain native functionalities may require extra customization or platform-specific code for advanced UI features.  
* Performance and size costs. Xamarin apps can have larger file sizes and may use more memory compared to purely native apps.  

## Follow-Up Actions

* Monitor and test the UI to ensure responsiveness and smooth functionality for smooth user interaction.  
* Keeping an eye on Xamarin updates. Make sure to stay up to date with latest releases for Xamarin.
